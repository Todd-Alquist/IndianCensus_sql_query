# Population and Demographics Analysis Using SQL

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing population and demographic data using SQL. The primary goal is to extract and interpret valuable insights through various SQL operations.

## Objectives

1. Understand the structure and contents of the datasets.
2. Perform data aggregation and statistical calculations.
3. Identify key demographic trends and insights.
4. Utilize SQL for comprehensive data analysis.

## Techniques Used

- **SQL Querying:** Retrieval of data using `SELECT` statements.
- **Aggregations:** Using `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT` functions to calculate totals, averages, and counts.
- **Filtering:** Using `WHERE` clauses to filter data based on specific conditions.
- **Joining Tables:** Combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`.
- **Temporary Tables:** Utilizing temporary tables to store intermediate results.
- **Window Functions:** Applying window functions for ranking and other advanced calculations.

## Tasks Performed

1. **Displaying the Data:**
   - Retrieved all records from `data1` and `data2` tables to provide an overview of the datasets.

3. **Counting Rows in the Datasets:**
   - Counted the number of rows in `data1` and `data2` tables.

4. **Filtering Data for Specific States:**
   - Filtered records for the states of Jharkhand and Bihar.

5. **Calculating the Population of India:**
   - Calculated the total population of India from the dataset.

6. **Calculating Average Growth by State:**
   - Calculated the average growth rate for each state.

7. **Calculating Average Sex Ratio by State:**
   - Calculated the average sex ratio for each state.

8. **Calculating Average Literacy Rate by State:**
   - Calculated the average literacy rate for each state and identified states with an average literacy rate above 90%.

9. **Top 3 States with Highest Growth Rate:**
   - Identified the top 3 states with the highest growth rates.

10. **Bottom 3 States with Lowest Sex Ratio:**
   - Identified the bottom 3 states with the lowest sex ratios.

11. **Top and Bottom 3 States in Literacy Rate:**
    - Determined the top and bottom 3 states based on literacy rates.

12. **States Starting with Specific Letters:**
    - Identified states starting with the letters 'A' or 'B', and those starting with 'A' and containing 'M'.

13. **Joining Tables to Calculate Totals:**
    - Calculated total males and females, and total literacy rate by joining data from multiple tables.

14. **Calculating Population from Previous Census:**
    - Estimated population figures from the previous census period.
